# Black_Friday_Sale
I have collected the purchase data of a superstore on the Black Friday Sale. I have analysed the data for better inventory management and increasing the sale for the future Black Friday. I have used Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, etc for achieving the goal.
Due to the use of Plotly library for making interactive graphs, the ipython notebook exceeds the uploading size limit. Thus I have uploaded few screenshots as well as the link for Geographical Graph.
