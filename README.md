# Black_Friday_Sale
I have collected the purchase data of a superstore on the Black Friday Sale. I have analysed the data for better inventory management and increasing the sale for the future Black Friday. I have used Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, etc for achieving our goal.
